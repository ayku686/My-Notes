Hello,
Now since you have landed on this page let me introduce myself to you.
I am Ayush Kumar and this is my first project on Flutter.
This app is a notes app which uses Firebase for authentication and FireStore for storage of data.
This notes app allows the user to Create, Update, Delete and Share his/her notes. Also each user has his own account in which he can store his notes.


Below are some of the screenshots of the UI of my notes app
